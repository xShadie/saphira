[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/systems/common/theowahdan.png; Y=10; X=446]

[X_PADDING=12]Each stole costume starts with 6 pre-set bonuses:
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Monsters
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Metin stones
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Bosses
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Half Human
[X_PADDING=20]- Half Human Resistance
[X_PADDING=20]- Max. HP

[X_PADDING=12]The stole costume has 4 ranks and based on the rank the maximum bonus percentages increase.

[X_PADDING=12]Maximum percentages of bonuses:
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Monsters +20%
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Metin stones 20%
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Bosses 20%
[X_PADDING=20]- Strong Against Half Human +15%
[X_PADDING=20]- Half Human Resistance 15%
[X_PADDING=20]- Max. HP +3000

[X_PADDING=12]To change the percentages of the costume stole you need the item Enchant Costume Stole.

[X_PADDING=12]To increase the rank of the stole costume you need to combine it from the NPC Theowahdan, a stole costume can
[X_PADDING=12]be combined only with the same type of stole and with the same grade.
[X_PADDING=12](Beware the combination shuffles the bonus percentages according to the new rank and there is a risk that
[X_PADDING=12]the combination may fail).
[X_PADDING=12]It is possible to transfer the bonuses of one stole costume to another costume with the item Transfer Bonus Costume
[X_PADDING=12]going to Theowahdan.
