[X_PADDING=82]Freeze Bonus							 Refreeze Bon.							Scongela Bonus

[X_PADDING=12;CENTER_ALIGN]If you move the Bonus Freeze to any equipment item that has bonuses, it is frozen
[X_PADDING=12;CENTER_ALIGN]a totally random bonus. Talisman bonuses cannot be frozen.

[X_PADDING=12]Beware when a bonus is frozen it has no effect on your character and until it is thawed
[X_PADDING=12]it will not be possible to improve, craft and absorb the item on a Shoulder Sash.

[X_PADDING=12]Bonuses that cannot be frozen are:
[X_PADDING=20]Medium damage
[X_PADDING=20]Skill Damage
[X_PADDING=20]Double Strong against Half humans (for example if we have a Triton Sword with double halfmen already using the
[X_PADDING=20]freeze bonus that bonus is not frozen).

[X_PADDING=12]The Refreeze Bonus is used when you already have a frozen bonus on the item that we do not like,
[X_PADDING=12]and then try to freeze a new bonus always randomly.

[X_PADDING=12]The Defrost Bonus is used to defrost a bonus that we have on one of our items.
[X_PADDING=12]When the bonus is thawed, it will be possible to make improvements, craft and absorb the item again
[X_PADDING=12]on a Shoulder Sash, and the character regains the effectiveness of that bonus.
