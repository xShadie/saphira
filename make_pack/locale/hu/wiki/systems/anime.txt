[X_PADDING=81]Enlightened oniricha soul																					Illuminated celestial soul

[X_PADDING=12] SOUL ONIRICHA  AND CELESTIAL SOUL 
[X_PADDING=20]- Soul Oniricha empower physical attacks.
[X_PADDING=20]- The Celestial Soul boosts the damage dealt by abilities.
[X_PADDING=20]- The boost is granted to a defined number of hits made against a target, after which the
[X_PADDING=20]enhancement will vanish.

[X_PADDING=12]Upgrades are not activated during a transformation or PvP combat.
[X_PADDING=12]Attacks made by riding a  horses are empowered but only against monsters, not against other PCs.

[X_PADDING=12]To load the soul you have to wait at least 60 minutes in game, as soon as the soul is loaded the tooltip (description
[X_PADDING=12]which appears only if you position the mouse over the object) will appear in green and can be activated.
[X_PADDING=12]After a certain period of consecutive offline time (about an hour), the soul discharges and will have to wait
[X_PADDING=12]again to load it.
[X_PADDING=12]From the Iridescent Degree onwards, the more time passes the more the amplification of the damage that the soul grants increases: the first
[X_PADDING=12]increase reaches 2/3 of the maximum charge and the second (if present) at maximum charge.. 
[X_PADDING=12]From the Prismatic rank onwards, the soul is able to provide 2 "stacks" of the upgrade, scaling to the previous rank
[X_PADDING=12](500 hits with damage multiplied by 2.5 and then another 500 with damage multiplied by 1.8, for example).
[X_PADDING=12]At the Enlightened rank, the soul does not discharge by staying offline.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]DEGREE OF SOULS

[X_PADDING=12]The souls can be of 5 different degrees, according to them the percentage of the boost received and the
[X_PADDING=12]number of possible shots to make.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]HOW TO ENHANCE THE DEGREE OF A SOUL

[X_PADDING=12]- To upgrade the rank of a soul you need the Scroll of the Soul, it works like a Sacred Papyrus, just
[X_PADDING=12]drag the parchment over the chosen soul and the up screen will appear.
[X_PADDING=12]- On the contrary, using a Scroll of the Soul (100%) the enhancement is guaranteed.
[X_PADDING=12]- In case of failure, the soul does not break and only the scroll is consumed. All its features
[X_PADDING=12]remain unchanged, including shots, remaining time, and current charge.
[X_PADDING=12]- If successful, the soul rises to the next rank, the number of hits left is reset, and the deadline comes
[X_PADDING=12]reset; any charge present will be lost with the up, so you will have to wait for it to charge again.
